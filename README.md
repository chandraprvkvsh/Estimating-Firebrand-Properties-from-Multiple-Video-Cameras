# Estimating-Firebrand-Properties-from-Multiple-Video-Cameras

Welcome to the Estimating-Firebrand-Properties-from-Multiple-Video-Cameras project! In this project, we utilize image data collected from a system of 4 video cameras to characterize firebrands, pieces of burning material generated during wildland fires.

## Background
Wildland fires have caused significant destruction to communities worldwide. Understanding the characteristics of firebrands is crucial for protecting communities from firebrand ignition. Firebrands, when carried by the wind, can ignite vegetation and structures, spreading fires rapidly. This project aims to investigate firebrand characteristics using image data from multiple video cameras.

## Project Statement
The goal of this project is to characterize firebrands using image data. The researcher aims to understand various properties of firebrands, including energy content, propensity for ignition, size, shape, and orientation. We address the following questions:
a) What is the energy content of the firebrand, and what is its propensity for ignition?
b) What are the size and orientation of the firebrand?
c) What is the general shape of the firebrand?

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10H3ohDJTGproNjZPn0SBZhzTwMjuUd6w/view?usp=sharing).

## Note
1. We initially tackle the classification problem to determine the shape of the firebrands, as this information is necessary for approaching the regression problem. 
2. The original dataset is used for the classification task, and then three CSV files are exported for use in the regression problem.
3. To access the Python notebooks, please download the entire repository as a .zip file. We apologize for any inconvenience and will address this compatibility issue soon.
